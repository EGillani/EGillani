# ðŸ‘‹ Hello, Iâ€™m Eraj 
## Welcome to my github page! 

I am currently a Computer Programming and Analyst student and hoping to land **Software Development/Programming** positions to increase my experience and competency in this field. My previous employers as a candidate that is willing to learn and have great initiative. I also come from a multidisciplinary background that includes spatial data and environmental science. With my diverse background and working a different set of teams allowed me to grow skills to utilizing different sets of data and cross-functional collaboration to translate business requirements into functional specifications. 

My experience includes:
  - Full-stack application development (HTML, CSS, Javascript, Jquery, C#, SQL) 
  - Designed databases, stored procedures, functions, views, and queries (SQL) 
  - Multiprocessing and concurrency (Python: aiohttp, aysncio) 
  - RESTful API (GET, PUT, POST, DELETE) and handling data conversion (JSON responses to CSV or insert into SQL) 
  - Data Wrangling
