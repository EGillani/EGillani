# Hello ðŸ‘‹, Iâ€™m Eraj 
## Welcome to my github page! 

I am currently a Computer Programming and Analyst student and hoping to land **Software Development** positions to increase my experience and competency in this field. I would love the opportunity to work with a team and contribute positively to a developing product. My previous employers consistently complimented that I am willing to learn and have great initiative. I also come from a multidisciplinary background that includes spatial data and environmental science. With my diverse background and my experience working with a variety of individuals, I gained experience interacting with different types of data and consistently using cross-functional collaboration to translate business requirements into functional specifications. 

My current experience includes (expanding hopefully~):
  - Full-stack application development (HTML, CSS, Javascript, Jquery, C#, SQL) 
  - C++ coding experience including encapsulation, polymorphism, inheritance, data structures (vectors, linkedlists, etc),and exception handling
  - C coding experience (dynamic memory allocation), arrays, and structs 
  - Designed databases, stored procedures, functions, views, and queries (SQL) 
  - Multiprocessing and concurrency (Python: aiohttp, asyncio) 
  - RESTful API and AJAX calls
  - Handling data formating, cleansing, and conversion to different formats
  - Data Wrangling

Currently Learning:
- COBOL (IBM Developer) 
- Mobile Application Development (Android Studio - Java) 
- Improving skill level on other languages currently experienced in
