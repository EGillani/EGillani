I am currently a Computer Programming and Analyst student and hoping to land **Software Development** positions to increase my experience and competency in this field. I would love the opportunity to work with a team and contribute positively to a developing product. My previous employers consistently complimented that I am willing to learn and have great initiative.

  - C++/C# coding experience including encapsulation, polymorphism, inheritance, data structures,and exception handling
  - Designed databases, stored procedures, functions, views, and queries (SQL)
